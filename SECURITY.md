# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Although this is a private project, I feel responsible for fixing security vulnerabilities if the project is public and could therefore be used by someone.
Please report a security vulnerability to the email address provided in my GitHub profile. I will fix security vulnerabilities if they could endanger the user or the program during normal use.
